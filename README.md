## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# Flavors
  This template support two flavors (production & staging)

- you can run the app directly from terminal using this command line:

  ``` flutter run --flavor production ```
  
  or for staging

  ``` flutter run --flavor staging ```

     
 - or you need to add new flutter configration for each flavor  (staging and production)

    flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main -f flutter_launcher_icons.yaml

   3- run this command to generate production flavor icons
   
    flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main -f flutter_launcher_icons-staging.yaml

# Enviroment Properties

# Localization

# Themes

# Firebase Integration

  We use [flutterfire](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire) plugins to integrate app with firebase services, a long with [flutterfire cli](https://github.com/invertase/flutterfire_cli) to generate all firbase files and configurations for both platform android and ios.
  
  [flutterfire cli](https://github.com/invertase/flutterfire_cli) depends on [firebase cli](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) tool so we need to install flutter cli first.
  
  ###  Install and activate firebase cli (if not installed):
  
   1- for mac or linux you can simply run this command from terminal 
    
    curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
       
   2- for windows check [firebase cli docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#windows-npm) ðŸŒš
    
   3- login to your firebase account using this commnd 
    
    firebase login
        
   (This command connects your local machine to Firebase and grants you access to your Firebase projects.)
        
  ### Flutterfire configure:
        
   1-  install flutterfire cli.

    dart pub global activate flutterfire_flavor_cli
		        
   2- run flutterfire configure command from you project path and follow up the commnd options.
      
    flutterfire configure
                   
   3- add [firebase_core](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core) plugin to the project .
   
    flutter pub add firebase_core
            
   4- on ```main_production.dart``` file intizalize firebase app.
           
    await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,);
            
  and make sure you import ```firebase_options_production.dart``` file.
          
  5- on ```main_staging.dart``` file intizalize firebase app
            
    await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,);
      
   and make sure you import ```firebase_options_staging.dart``` file.
